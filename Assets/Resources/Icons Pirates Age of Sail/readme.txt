Use of Assets

Using Unity these can work equally well as a UI "Image" or as "Sprite" in worldspace, depending on your needs.


Future Expansion

Feel free to send me an email with icon ideas to round out this set if you feel like there's something missing! I've got my own list of ideas and will likely put out updates in the future.
